# ü¶• Lazy Developer Font Installer üöÄ

Are you tired of manually installing fonts like some kind of digital caveman? Do you find yourself dozing off while dragging and dropping font files? Well, wake up and smell the coffee ‚òï, because the Lazy Developer Font Installer is here to save your day (and your wrists)!

## üéâ Features

- Installs fonts faster than you can say "Comic Sans is overrated"
- Searches directories deeper than your existential coding crisis
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (because we're equal-opportunity lazy)
- Comes with a dry-run option for the commitment-phobes among us

## üõ† Installation

1. Clone this repo (or download it, we don't judge)
2. Make sure you have Python installed (if not, how are you even a developer? ü§î)
3. That's it! No `pip install` required. We're lazy, remember?

## üöÄ Usage

### Step 1: Navigate to the Script Directory

First things first, let's make sure you're in the right place:

1. Open your command prompt or terminal (with admin powers, remember?)
2. Navigate to the directory containing `font_installer.py`

```bash
cd path\to\lazy-font-installer
```

Replace `path\to\lazy-font-installer` with the actual path where you cloned or downloaded the repo.

### Step 2: Run the Script

Now that you're in the right spot, let's make some magic happen!

#### For the Truly Lazy

```bash
python font_installer.py
```

This will install all fonts in your current directory. Magic! ‚ú®

#### For the Slightly Less Lazy

```bash
python font_installer.py -d C:\path\to\your\fonts
```

Replace `C:\path\to\your\fonts` with your actual font directory. We believe in you!

#### For the Paranoid Lazy

```bash
python font_installer.py --dry-run
```

This shows what would happen if you weren't too lazy to actually install the fonts.

#### For the Curious Lazy

```bash
python font_installer.py -v
```

Get verbose output. It's like the font installer's stream of consciousness.

#### For the Overachieving Lazy

```bash
python font_installer.py -d C:\fonts --dry-run -v
```

Combine options like a pro! We're so proud of you for typing all that.

### For Windows Users: Summoning Admin Powers üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Before you start, you need to open your command prompt with the mystical admin rights:

1. Press `Win + X` (it's like Ctrl+Alt+Delete, but for cool kids)
2. Click on "Command Prompt (Admin)" or "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"
3. If a scary-looking UAC prompt appears, click "Yes" (don't worry, it's not a virus... probably)

Alternatively, for the keyboard ninjas:
1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type `cmd`
3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` (it's like Enter, but with superpowers)

Now you're ready to wield the awesome power of font installation!

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "No such file or directory" Error

If you see an error like this:
```
python: can't open file 'C:\\path\\to\\font_installer.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

Don't panic! You're just not in the right directory. Here's how to fix it:

1. Make sure you've actually downloaded or cloned the repo. (We won't judge if you forgot this step... much)
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the correct directory:
   ```
   cd C:\path\to\lazy-font-installer
   ```
3. Once you're in the right spot, try running the script again.

If you're still stuck, try using the `dir` command (on Windows) or `ls` command (on macOS/Linux) to see if `font_installer.py` is actually in your current directory. If not, you might need to do some detective work to find where you put it. (We've all been there.)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Running this script might make you so efficient that your boss gives you more work. Use at your own risk!

## ü§ì Pro Tips

- On Windows, always run your command prompt as admin. It's like having a VIP pass to the font party.
- If you're on Linux or macOS, just throw a sudo in front of the command. Boom! Admin powers!
